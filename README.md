## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing FZF Directory Navigator, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- `zsh`: Z shell (your default shell should be zsh)
- `fzf`: Fuzzy finder for the core search functionality
- `fd`: Modern alternative to `find` for fast directory/file searching
- `bat`: Syntax highlighting for file previews
- `lsd`: Modern `ls` alternative for enhanced directory listings
- Optional but recommended:
  - `chafa`: Terminal graphics for image preview support
  - `imgcat`: Alternative image preview for iTerm2 users

Most dependencies can be installed via your package manager:

- On macOS with Homebrew
  ```bash
  brew install fzf fd bat lsd chafa
  ```
- On Ubuntu/Debian
  ```bash
  sudo apt install fzf fd-find bat lsd chafa
  ```
- On Arch Linux
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S fzf fd bat lsd chafa
  ```

### Using Zinit

1. First ensure you have [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) installed.

2. Add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
# Basic usage
zinit load jabafett/fzf-cd

# For turbo mode (faster startup)
zinit ice wait lucid
zinit load jabafett/fzf-cd

# Optional: Override the default keybinding
bindkey '^g' ___fzf_cd  # Changes binding to Ctrl+G
```

The plugin will automatically:
- Install and configure all required dependencies (fzf, fd, bat, lsd)
- Set up the necessary scripts and completions
- Configure the default keybinding (Ctrl+F)

After adding the configuration:
```bash
# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc

# Or install/update the plugin directly
zinit update jabafett/fzf-cd
```

### Automatic Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jabafett/fzf-cd.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd fzf-cd
   ```

3. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

4. Follow the prompts to configure your preferred key binding (default: Ctrl+F)

5. Restart your shell or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Manual Installation

1. Create the necessary directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/bin ~/.local/lib/fzf-cd
   ```

2. Copy the scripts to their locations:
   ```bash
   cp fzf-cd ~/.local/bin/
   cp fzf-cd-lib ~/.local/lib/fzf-cd/
   cp fzf-cd-preview ~/.local/lib/fzf-cd/
   ```

3. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.local/bin/fzf-cd
   chmod +x ~/.local/lib/fzf-cd/fzf-cd-lib
   chmod +x ~/.local/lib/fzf-cd/fzf-cd-preview
   ```

4. Add the following configuration to your `~/.zshrc`:
   ```zsh
   # Fuzzy Directory Navigator Configuration
   fzf-cd-my-widget() {
     BUFFER="fzf-cd"
     zle accept-line
   }
   zle -N fzf-cd-my-widget
   bindkey '^f' fzf-cd-my-widget  # Change '^f' to your preferred key binding
   ```

```

export FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS=80 # Set preview width
```

### Environment Variables

You can customize the behavior by setting these environment variables:

```bash
export EDITOR='nvim'  # Set your preferred editor
export BAT_STYLE="numbers"  # Customize bat preview style
export FZF_THEME="dark"    # Set to "light" for light terminal themes
```
